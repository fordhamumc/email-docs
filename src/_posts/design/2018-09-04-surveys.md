An easy way to capture simple responses is through [surveys](https://mailchimp.com/help/send-a-simple-poll-or-survey-to-subscribers/#add+a+survey+to+a+campaign). 

Surveys can be included by adding the following code to your email:

~~~html
<div class="link">
*|SURVEY: Option 1|*
*|SURVEY: Option 2|*
*|SURVEY: Option 3|*
</div>
~~~

If you know you are going to send a reminder and want people to be able to opt out of receiving those reminders, you could include the following below your register button:

~~~html
<div class="link">
*|SURVEY: I cannot attend. Please do not send me any reminders about this event.|*
</div>
~~~

Anyone who clicks the **I cannot attend** link can be excluded from future emails by using the Poll / Survey Activity segment parameter.
