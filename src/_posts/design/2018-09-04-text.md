Don't change font sizes directly in the text, use the presized headers/text sizes that are already there. If you need to change the size of a header you may do so on the right **Design** tab by selecting **Headings** and changing the size there. 

Links should be written in a way that if you read the link you can understand what you are clicking. For example "Learn more about the Center on Religion and Culture" instead of "Learn more."

If you absolutely do not have the room to make a link descriptive, you can use the `aria-label` attribute to override what screen readers will read. 

~~~html
<a href="URL" aria-label="Register for the Spring Lake Reception" target="_blank">Register</a>
~~~

Make sure links do not include old tracking code, google analytics parameters, etc. 

Google and Apple wrap dates and addresses in links to create calendar events. While you can't avoid this, you can style the links to look like regular text with the `textlink` class. 
~~~html
<span class="textlink">Your content</span>
~~~
