Images need to be saved at a larger size than they will be displayed in order to be clear on high pixel density screens like iPhones and Macs. 

Once you select a content block for your image, refer to the **[Content Block Types](/blocks/)** page for the appropriate width for your image. 

Your image file size should be as small as possible. If you have Photoshop, use **File > Export > Save for Web (legacy)** and the following settings:

![Save for web settings]({{site.image_path}}/{{page.category}}/photoshop.jpg)

If you don't have Photoshop, you can use **[ImageOptim online](https://imageoptim.com/online)** to compress your image(s). Please try to keep your images below 200kb.

To add your image select the gray placeholder image and select **Replace**.

If you are uploading a new image, select a folder and then select **Upload**. 

Select **Alt** and add text to describe the image. *This is important for screen readers.*

If you would like the image to be a link, select **Link** and paste in the URL.
 
Select the **Settings** tab, uncheck **Keep Proportions** and add the corresponding "Render Size" from the **[Content Block Types](/blocks/)** page. 

**‚ùó*PLEASE AVOID DESIGNING IMAGES*** Images with text and collage images can often become illegible on small screens. Please limit the images you use to photographs. If you would like an image designed, like a banner or type treatment, please contact your project manager in Marketing.
