Within a content block, you can hide certain elements.

Click ![hide icon]({{site.image_path}}/{{page.category}}/hide-icon.jpg){:width="24"} to toggle the show/hide status of the element.

A hidden element will have less opacity in the design view but will be completely removed in previews and when the email is sent. 

![Add/remove a content block]({{site.image_path}}/{{page.category}}/hide-content.gif)
