Before sending, make sure to double check links, spelling, an image sizes.

Send yourself a test. From the message setup page click **Edit Design**

In the **Preview and Test** dropdown click **Send a test email**.

_Check the email on both desktop and mobile._

Once the test looks good forward it to the **Always Send Group** along with any other people involved in the project who should see the final copy.

When you forward the test please add the date and time the email will go out and remove your personal unsubscribe information from the bottom of the forwarded email to make sure no one unsubscribes you by mistake.
