If you are uploading a list with new contacts (e.g. freshmen parents who we haven't reached out to before) you will need to import these contacts first. Otherwise you can skip to **[Creating a Tag](#tag)**.

**❗*ONLY IMPORT CONTACTS THAT WANT TO HEAR FROM US.*** Please do not import contacts from purchased or harvested lists. We should only be contacting people that are apart of the Fordham community in some way. Purchased and harvested lists have very high bounce/unsubscribe/complaint rates that can negatively impact our sender rating or cause us to be blacklisted. If you're not sure where the list came from, don't use it. 

Save your list as a CSV including:
* First Name
* Last Name
* Preferred Email Address
* FIDN (optional)

Select **Lists** from the top navigation.

Select **Fordham Master List**

In the **Add Contacts** dropdown menu, select **Import Contacts**

Select **CSV or tab-delimited text file** and click **Next**

Select **Browse** and locate your CSV file and click **Next**

Map the fields in your CSV file to the appropriate Mailchimp fields and click **Next**
* First Name -> First Name
* Last Name -> Last Name
* Preferred Email -> Email
* FIDN -> ID Number

Set the **Status** to **Subscribed** and check **Update existing contacts**

Click **Import**
