Set your **Delivery Date**. 

For **Delivery Time** you can either select a **Specific Time** from the dropdown

or 

Select **Let Mailchimp Optimize** to calculate a time based on when the people on your list are most likely to open.

If your list is more than 10,000 people, you can send your campaign in batches to prevent overloading the website. We recommend 1 batch for every 15,000 people set 10 minutes apart. 

Click **Schedule Campaign**.
