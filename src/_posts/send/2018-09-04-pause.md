If you need to make changes to a message that's already in the queue you can pause it.

Select **Campaigns**. 

Select **Ongoing** and find your message.

Click the **Pause and Edit** button and then click **Pause**.

Once you are ready to put the message back in the queue, click **Resume Campaign** to reschedule your campaign. 

You cannot pause an email that has already begun sending. If you set the message to send in batches we may be able to stop part of the email from going out so contact Joan, Mike, or Amanda right away.
