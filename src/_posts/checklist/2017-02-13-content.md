The content for the email is generally due 1 week before the send date.

- **Subject**: This should be descriptive but concise and highlight the most likely draw of the email.

- **Preheader**: The text that comes after the subject line when an email is viewed in your inbox. It should be used in conjunction with the subject to entice the reader to click.

- **Content**: Event emails should include title, date, time, and location. If there is a lot of information (speaker bios, long schedules, etc.) they should be on the event webpage.
- **Call to action**: With the exception of newsletters, each email should have one clear call to action. 
- **Image(s)**: [See the content blocks section]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link blocks.html %}) for the various image sizes.
