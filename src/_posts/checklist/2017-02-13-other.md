- **Event website**: Make sure the event website is up-to-date before the send date.
- **Reminder emails**: Does the client want to send a reminder email? 
  - Audience: Who should receive the reminder? Everyone (not recommended for lists larger than 10,000), people who opened, or some other segment
  - Content: Do they want to change email body?
  - Attendees/donors: We will need a list of people who have signed up/donated/etc so we can exclude them from the reminder.
  - Subject: The subject must be different from the original, even if slightly, to avoid being combined with the original message.
- **Social media links**: The social media links in the footer of each email are set to the alumni or University accounts by default. These can be changed or removed if requested.
- **Purchased lists**: We cannot send to purchased lists. These have a notoriously high abuse rate and can affect our sender rating.
- **Outside lists**: If a client or guest speaker maintains their own list of mostly non-Fordham constituents we discourage mailing to their list. Sending Fordham-branded emails to these lists tend to have low open rates and create confusion among the recipients. We find it is more effective for the client to message their own list and we can provide any images or copy they may need.
