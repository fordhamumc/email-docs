This is the minimum content needed to put an email on the calendar and should be done as early as possible.

- Job number and name
- Proposed send date
- Measurable goals for the email
- Target audience, which should include the criteria for the list. Amanda will let you know if you will need to have a list pulled or if we can pull the list directly in Mailchimp. 

  Example target audiences: 
  - All Gabelli undergrads who live in NYC plus 50 miles.
  - All young alumni who have made a gift in the past but have not given this year.
  - All former basketball players and athletics donors.
